Zhangjiajie National Forest Park, located in the northern part of Hunan Province, China, is famous for its stunning natural beauty. The park is renowned for its towering sandstone pillars, which inspired the floating mountains in the 2009 film *Avatar*. These unique formations, created by millions of years of erosion, create an otherworldly landscape that attracts visitors from around the globe. The park is also home to rich biodiversity, with lush forests, rare plants, and various wildlife. With its breathtaking scenery, Zhangjiajie has become one of China's most popular tourist destinations.

We went there in the August of 2024. The weather was smoking hot, but we got to appreciate the beauty depite the hot weather and huge crowd.
